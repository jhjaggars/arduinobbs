EEPROM filesystem (ha) notes
============================

The first two bytes are the write address bytes.
They store the current address to begin writing from.
They are ordered in a big endian fashion:

0 = MSByte
1 = LSByte

The current address is stored in an unsigned (16bit) int
allowing up to 64k of EEPROM to be addressed.

Currently each file is simply delimted by a null byte (\0).

When space is erased it is written over with a max byte (\255)
